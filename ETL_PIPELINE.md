# ETL Pipeline ‚Äì Procurement KPI Analysis

This document outlines the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline developed for the **Procurement KPI Analysis Project**. The pipeline automates the ingestion of raw procurement data, enriches it with temporal insights, and loads the processed dataset into **Google BigQuery** for downstream analysis.

<br><br>

## üîÅ Overview

**Purpose**: Transform a raw Kaggle dataset into a clean, analytics-ready table for Procurement KPI exploration.

**Pipeline Steps**:
1. **Extract** data from Kaggle.
2. **Transform** it using `pandas`, adding calculated date-based columns.
3. **Load** the final DataFrame into BigQuery under a predefined schema.

<br><br>

## üìÅ Dataset Source

- **Name**: [shahriarkabir/procurement-kpi-analysis-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shahriarkabir/procurement-kpi-analysis-dataset)
- **Tool**: [`kagglehub`](https://pypi.org/project/kagglehub/) used for downloading directly into the project environment.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

| Tool / Library     | Purpose                             |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `pandas`           | Data manipulation and transformation |
| `pandas_gbq`       | Uploading DataFrames to BigQuery     |
| `kagglehub`        | Programmatic dataset access from Kaggle |
| `dataframe_tools`  | Custom DataFrame inspector for EDA   |
| `Google BigQuery`  | Cloud-based data warehouse storage   |

<br><br>

## üß™ Transformations Applied

- **Date Parsing**: Converted `Order_Date` and `Delivery_Date` to datetime objects.
- **Time Period Derivations**:
  - `Order_Week_Start`: Week start (Saturday) of the order date
  - `Order_Month`: Month start of the order date
  - `Delivery_Week_Start`: Week start (Saturday) of the delivery date
  - `Delivery_Month`: Month start of the delivery date
- **Data Summary**: Used a custom `DataFrameInspector` class to inspect missing values, datatypes, and value distributions during preprocessing.

## üöÄ Output Table

- **Destination**: `Procurement_KPI_Sample.data`
- **Project**: `vivid-alchemy-388523`
- **Mode**: `replace` ‚Äî the dataset is overwritten on each ETL run to maintain consistency during experimentation.

## üß© Full Script

The full ETL implementation is located in the project as [`etl_pipeline.py`](etl_pipeline.py). The `main()` function orchestrates all steps, providing logging throughout the process.

```bash
python etl_pipeline.py
```
